[Music] the key to nailing a monologue is solid and intelligent preparation but there are some tips I can offer to make sure we perform the monologue well on the day first of all think of it as an opportunity to act don't focus so much on the outcome it's a chance to do what you love enjoy it for what it is and then forget the rest when we change our mindset many of the common acting problems are solved if you can bring a sense of play into your work it will be physically and vocally free and your acting will have a sense of ease and enjoyment which is infectious to watch number 2 warm up always be physically and vocally warmed up you will notice the difference for some reason many people think acting is just something you can jump straight into and maybe some people can roll out of bed and win an Oscar but I know personally they're doing a solid physical and vocal warmup makes all the difference number three bold choices do you have a gut instinct about how you want to perform the monologue even though I might not be conventional always follow your instinct but don't leave it to the last minute to decide to do something radical make sure it's something you have prepared and worked on a director can always rein in a bold choice but it shows bravery and creativity number four is authenticity I've just spoken about bold choices which is something that a lot of acting teachers talk about however don't fall into the trap of interpreting that as massive over-the-top character choices for most monologues you don't need to come on with a limp or an accent to differentiate yourself in most auditions they are looking for a kernel of something great an essence unique to you that no one else has you don't need to showcase all your acting skills in a two-minute monologue that would be near impossible number five expect things to change be flexible rehearse your monologue in different ways so that you can always respond to how you feel in the moment this will give you a sense of freedom and relaxation when it comes down to performing there are many factors that will affect how you perform and you need to be ready to respond in the moment number six a monologue is never meant to be a monologue a monologue isn't ever planned a character wants to say one line doesn't get what they want and so they try to say something else they are always striving to do something with their words which causes them to keep speaking if they got what they wanted they'd shut up and get on with it but instead they keep speaking investigate what it is your character wants but isn't getting and keep in mind the spontaneity that comes with not knowing what you're going to get number seven is Drive monologues can be intimidating blocks of text and it's tempting to rush through and get it over with but you need to find a way to breathe throughout your performance stay grounded alert and keep that drive objective or goal throughout at all play to win this is a great phrase don't ever slack off be relentless in your pursuit of your objective it makes for amazing drama number eight is thought changes what we all love to see when watching great actors is that elasticity of thoughts human beings never think about one idea for more than a few seconds we are constantly thinking evolving coming up with new ideas solving problems and reacting to stimuli do not forget the extraordinary capabilities of your mind when performing your monologue mark out these thought changes on your page and be clear when and why you're shifting thoughts number 9 remember who you're talking to make sure this is clear in your mind think also about the relationship to that person or to the audience and the reason for speaking to them this will help you with Drive lastly don't perform to camera a final technical note aim just to the side of the lens do not barrel the camera like I'm doing right now mark out some eye lines for yourself as you need to using bits of tape or objects in the room remember you are always talking to a person however and not a thing or if you are talking to yourself what does that look like if you are performing a monologue in front of a director or panel of teachers don't look at them it's just a bit uncomfortable and awkward keep your eye line just above them or if they have provided you with an actor to work with use them so there you have it ten thoughts on performing a monologue remember that we are always striving to achieve an honest present and detailed performance when you truly connect with a piece of text and trust yourself that's when you start getting accepted into drama schools getting recalls at auditions and most importantly booking professional acting jobs you
